# A mini version of Shell

It was a fun project I've learned a ton about lots of stuff including:

- Processes 

- Signals

- Pipes

- Tokenization

- Inter-process communication.

- Implimented multiple shell builtins like cd and export.

- Collaborating with others (The magnificent [@sdummett](https://github.com/sdummett))
